# stack-search

This readme icludes all the necessary information regarding the VS Code extension, stack-search, developed by the Code Warriors. stack-search is a search engine that helps you improve your efficiency while writing code. It makes your everyday programming productive.

## The Idea

stack-search is a search engine for one of the most popular forums, Stack Overflow.
We all know how important online forums are to developers and that there is an everyday use to them, however, everytime we have to search something on one of these forums, we have to switch windows to a browser, then search up our problem, check for solutions and then paste the code.
stack-search does this all for you within your code editor, you can search for problems, answers, and code snippets.

## Features

The initial input window is just a text input where you put in your question to be searched on stack overflow aand it will give you recommendations based on your input. All these questions will have answers to them, stack-search won't waste your time on the questions that don't have an answer.

stack-search directly pastes the code block regarding the verified or the most upvoted answer as soon as you hover on that question, you can still navigate to other answers if you do not find the last one useful.
If the answer doesn't contain a code block, the extension will bring up an information box to explain the answer.

# HOTKEYS:

- shift & ` (to bring up the extension input box)
- esc (to exit the extension input box once satisfied)
- shift & u (to undo whatever stack-search has done)
- shift & = (to see the next answer while hovering on a question)
- shift & - (to see the previous answer while hovering on a question)

**Enjoy!**
